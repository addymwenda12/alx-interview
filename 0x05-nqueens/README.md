### Description
The N Queens problem is a classic problem in computer science that is often used as a test of backtracking algorithms. The goal is to place N queens on an N x N chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. A queen threatens another queen if they are in the same row, column, or diagonal.

This project provides a solution to the N Queens problem using a backtracking algorithm implemented in Python. The solution finds all possible solutions to the problem and prints them out in a readable format.
