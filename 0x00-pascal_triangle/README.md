# Pascal's Triangle

This project is a Python implementation of Pascal's Triangle.

## Description

Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of binomial coefficients. Each number in the triangle is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The triangle starts with a single 1 at the top, and each row is constructed by adding a 0 at the beginning and end, and then summing adjacent elements from the row above.

## Features

- Generate Pascal's Triangle of a given size
- Print Pascal's Triangle in a formatted manner

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

	```shell
	git clone https://github.com/addymwenda12/alx-interview.git
	```

2. Change into the project directory:

	```shell
	cd 0x00-pascal_triangle
	```

3. Run the Python script:

	```shell
	0-pascal_triangle.py
	```

## Example

Here's an example output of the program:

	
	[1]
	[1,1]
	[1,2,1]
	[1,3,3,1]
	[1,4,6,4,1]
