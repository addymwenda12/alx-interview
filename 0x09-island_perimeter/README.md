# 0x09. Island Perimeter

This project is part of the ALX program. The main objective is to calculate the perimeter of an island represented in a 2D grid.

## Description

The island is represented by 1s and the water is represented by 0s. Cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells). The island doesn't have "lakes" (water inside that isn't connected to the water around the island). One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. 

## Usage

```python
python3 island_perimeter.py
```
