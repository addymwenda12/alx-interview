# :trophy: ALX Project: 0X0A. Prime Game

This project leverages the understanding of prime numbers, game theory, and algorithm optimization to solve a competitive game scenario. The challenge involves determining the winner of a game based on the strategic removal of prime numbers and their multiples from a set of consecutive integers.

## :books: Concepts Needed:

### :1234: Prime Numbers:
- Understanding what prime numbers are.
- Efficient algorithms for identifying prime numbers within a range.

### :mag: Sieve of Eratosthenes:
- An efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit, which can be particularly useful for this task.

### :game_die: Game Theory:
- Basic principles of competitive games where players take turns and the concept of optimal play.
- Understanding win conditions and strategies that lead to a win or loss.

### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Dynamic Programming/Memoization:
- Using previous results to make future calculations faster, potentially necessary for optimizing the solution for multiple rounds of the game.

### :snake: Python Programming:
- Loops and conditional statements for implementing game logic and algorithms.
- Arrays and lists for storing the integers and tracking removed numbers.
